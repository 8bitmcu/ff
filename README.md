## FF

ff is an opiniated, minimal looking theme for Firefox on Linux. It features:
- Lots of hidden visual components, or reduced by size
- Tab close button and new tab button only appears on hover
- menus are simplified, some items are removed for a cleaner look
- Seemless URL bar with no placeholder text
- Good comments in the CSS, should you choose to customize it

### Installation

Copy userChrome.css to the chrome folder under your firefox profile. You will need to enable `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` under `about:config`
